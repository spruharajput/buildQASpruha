QA-Testcases for build.com website data assessment test

Hello Team,

Here is my test project given by the team to automate Selenium Testcases.
Please note some important points I have mentioned here in order to execute test

1. This testcases have been developed and executed using Mac OS. So in order to execute tests on windows you need to make few changes in driver.
2. change driver path from "automation.properties"
3. download/install appropriate windows driver for chrome/firefox
4. By passing browser value in automation.properties, you can execute test on 3 different browsers
5. For email validation test case, i have used exact same email id given in test description.

Thanks.
Awaiting Feedback.
